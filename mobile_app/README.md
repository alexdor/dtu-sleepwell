# Sleep Well Mobile app

This folder contains the flutter project, this is the mobile app that the end user will interact.

In order to run this project you need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Once flutter is installed you need to run `flutter doctor` from the terminal, in order to verify the flutter installation.

Once Flutter and it's requirements are installed correctly you can follow these steps:

* Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
* Start an iOS or an Android emulator (an iOS emulator can be started from the application "xcode" and the android emulator can be started from the application "android studio").
* Run `flutter run`, after a while the application will be installed and launched on the emulator.

> Note: Each device has a local copy of the user's inputted data so if you open a new emulator (or if you delete the app) when you reopen the app the data from the app will be lost.
